          This section consists of a timed Analyze an Issue writing task.

        <p className="font-semibold">Important Notice</p>
        <p>
          Your essay response on the Analytical Writing section will be reviewed
          by ETS essay-similarity-detection software and by experienced essay
          readers during the scoring process. In light of the high value placed
          on independent intellectual activity within graduate schools and
          universities, your essay response should represent your original work.
          ETS reserves the right to cancel test scores of any test taker when an
          essay response includes, but is not limited to, any of the following:
        </p>
        <br />
        <div>
          <ul>
            <li>
              text that is unusually similar to that found in one or more other
              test essay responses;
            </li>
            <li>
              quoting or paraphrasing, without attribution, language that
              appears in published or unpublished sources; including sources
              from the Internet and/or sources provided by any third party;
            </li>
            <li>
              unacknowledged use of work that has been produced through
              collaboration with others without citation of the contribution of
              others;
            </li>
            essays submitted as work of the test taker that appear to have been
            borrowed in whole or in part from elsewhere or prepared by another
            person.
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          When one or more of the preceding circumstances occurs, ETS may
          conclude, in its professional judgment, that the essay response does
          not reflect the independent writing skills that this test seeks to
          measure. When ETS reaches that conclusion, it cancels the Analytical
          Writing score, and because Analytical Writing scores are an integral
          part of the GRE General Test scores, those scores are canceled as
          well.
